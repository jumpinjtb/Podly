# Podly

Project overview

In our project, we will be creating a desktop podcast manager that will allow the user to search and subscribe to podcasts. Once subscribed, the podcasts will appear in a feed on the screen for the user. When searching for podcasts, you will be able to query iTunes for the podcast that you are looking for. Podly will also support importing and exporting of the current podcasts that you listen to as OPML files.
There will also be an option to search for and subscribe to podcasts via entering its RSS feeds. You will be able to play the podcast through a built-in audio player in the app, and switch between podcasts at any time. Using data from the iTunes library, you will be able to see any art and notes attached with said podcast that you are listening to that are on iTunes.
 Podly will also give you a constant stats option that follows what you have been listening to and keeps track of your total listening time. It will give a top 5 podcast listing for the podcasts that you have spent the most time listening to. There will also be a feature that will count the collective time listened to all of the podcasts that you are currently subscribed to. 
 You can also opt-in for desktop notifications when your podcasts update with a new episode, or just the specific podcasts that you like the best. As an optional feature, different UI themes could be added, such as Light and Dark.
